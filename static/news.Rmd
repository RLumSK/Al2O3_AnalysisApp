### Version 0.1.7 (2019-01-16)

* Add additional columns in the panel 'Post-processing'
* The table in the panel 'Post-processing' is now active and plots whatever is provided

#### Bugfixes
* The dose value in the plots in the subtext in the panel 
'Analyse' was not shown correctly; fixed. '
* The cosmic dose was not subtracted correclty; fixed.


### Version 0.1.5 (2018-12-20)

* Add current and calibration dose rate disply in tab 'Analyse'

### Version 0.1.4 (2018-09-20)
* If the position numbering did not start with position 1, this was not displayed correctly on the carousel plot and the travel dosimeter correction did not work; fixed.
* The sample names in the boxplot are now displayed with a 45Ëš angle to avoid overplotting.
* The auto-generated sample ids used the position numbers, but without a leading 0. This caused some re-ordering of the samples in the last panel; fixed. 

### Version 0.1.3

This in particular helpful if you want to mix different files for one analysis.
